NAME
      Geometric phase calculator. 
SYNOPSIS
      Computes the geometric phase and number of enclosed conical intersections of different 
      electronic structure methods.
USAGE
      berryCalc [-f <matrix_file>] [--print-level <print_level>] [--method <method>] 
        [--help] 
OPTIONS
   1. Input/output

      -f matrix_file                   Input file giving wavefunction at each point on closed loop. 
                                       The first line contains the number of matrix files in the 
                                       input, and then on each line is a separate matrix file.

      --print-level print_level        Verbosity of output. Default print level is 1. Options
                                       0-4.

      --determinant-length number      Determinants are stored on the input matrix file in records 
                                       titled MO GRID POINT # (preceded by either ALPHA or BETA), 
                                       where # is a number up to the specified determinant length. 
                                       A vector with determinant weights should also be stored under 
                                       the record GRID POINT WEIGHTS, where the vector is of the same 
                                       length as the determinant length. Default is zero which just 
                                       reads from the standard MO coefficient record.

      --help                           Output help documentation to terminal.

NOTES
      Compilation of this program requires the MQC library (https://github.com/MQCPack/mqcPack)
      and the gauopen utility (http://gaussian.com/g16/gauopen.zip) and compilation with the
      f08 standard.

      Compilation tested using: gfortran 9.2.0

      Note that subroutine Wr_LCBuf needs modifying in gauopen/qcmatrix.F as follows:
        line 58:       LenBX = (LenBuf/(2*abs(NR)))*abs(NR)
        line 60:       Call Wr_CBuf(IU,NTot*abs(NR),LenBX,X)

      Documentation generated with robodoc. To update documentation edit robodoc.rc to
      determine documentation output type and then run robodoc at the command line in the
      main directory.
